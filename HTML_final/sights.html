      <h1>Sourrounded by Water</h1>

          <p>On a beautiful island there are many wonderful sights! The beach is a fabulous playground. Spend a few hours or the entire day lounging around. If that's too tranquil, take in some beach volleyball. Or maybe water sports are your thing.
          </p>


      <p>With warm weather year-round and only short rain showers, it is ideal to get out and have fun. Tourist attractions are plentiful. Also, just ask for one of the off-the-beaten track locations for the adventurer!
      </p>



      <p>Check out the locations pictured below. They are all beatiful!
